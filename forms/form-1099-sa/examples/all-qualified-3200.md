# Example: HSA Holder Paying $3,200 of Qualified Medical Expenses

The canonical "everything is qualified" Form 1099-SA case. The user took distributions during the year, all for legitimate medical expenses, and owes no tax or penalty on the distribution.

This example shows that **Form 8889 Part II is still required** even when there's no taxable amount — the form documents the QME treatment to the IRS.

Aisha matches every dollar of the $3,200 distribution to a QME with a receipt. Her HSA portal "Distribution by category" report confirms this.

## Step-by-step computation

### Step 1 — Confirm Box 5 = HSA → Form 8889

Yes → Form 8889 Part II.

### Step 2 — Box 3 = Code 1 (Normal distribution)

Standard treatment: non-QME portion taxable + 20% penalty if under 65. Aisha is 38, so penalty would apply if any non-QME existed.

### Step 3 — QME total = $3,200

Matches Box 1 exactly. Aisha kept careful records throughout the year using a spreadsheet she updates after each HSA debit card swipe.

### Step 4-5 — Form 8889 Part II computation

```
Line 14a (Total distributions):                  $3,200
Line 14b (Rollovers):                            $0
Line 14c (14a − 14b):                            $3,200
Line 15 (QME paid using HSA):                    $3,200
Line 16 (Taxable distributions, 14c − 15):       $0
Line 17a (Exception):                            N/A (Line 16 = $0, no penalty)
Line 17b (20% additional tax):                   $0

## Why each non-obvious choice

**Why is Form 8889 Part II filed even with Line 16 = $0?** Two reasons:
1. The IRS receives a copy of Aisha's 1099-SA from HealthEquity. If the IRS sees a $3,200 distribution but no Form 8889 from Aisha, it triggers a CP2000 notice assuming the entire $3,200 is taxable. Filing Form 8889 with $0 taxable PROVES the distribution was for QME.
2. Form 8889 also handles Aisha's $4,300 HSA contribution (Part I) — Form 8889 is the single form covering both contributions and distributions for the year.

**Why is therapy with Sarah Brooks (LCSW) qualified?** Mental health services from a licensed mental health provider are QME under IRC §213(d) and Pub 502. LCSW (Licensed Clinical Social Worker) is a qualified provider. The same would apply to LMFT (marriage and family therapist) or psychologist.

**Why are OTC allergy medications now QME?** The CARES Act (2020) restored OTC medications and menstrual care products to the QME list. Before 2020, OTC items required a prescription to be QME — that requirement was removed for 2020 and onward.

**Why Aisha's vision glasses qualify?** Corrective eyewear (glasses, contacts, contact solution, vision exams, even some over-the-counter reading glasses) are QME. Cosmetic colored contacts without vision correction would NOT be.

**What about Aisha's gym membership?** Aisha didn't include it. Gym memberships are generally NOT QME unless prescribed by a physician for a specific medical condition (with a Letter of Medical Necessity). For general fitness, no.

**What if Aisha had used the HSA debit card at a Whole Foods checkout for some non-medical groceries?** That portion would be non-QME → taxable + 20% penalty. The HSA debit card system doesn't pre-validate every transaction; some custodians block obviously-non-medical merchant codes, but coding errors slip through. Aisha's spreadsheet and receipt retention catch these.

## Audit defense

If the IRS questioned Aisha's Form 8889 Part II:
1. Aisha presents her HSA portal "Distribution by category" report showing $3,200 in distributions matched to medical merchant codes
2. For each distribution, Aisha presents a receipt showing date, provider, patient (Aisha herself), service description, and amount
3. The therapy sessions are substantiated by Sarah Brooks LCSW's invoices listing CPT codes for behavioral health therapy
4. The OTC purchases are substantiated by CVS register receipts showing item descriptions
5. Total QME = $3,200 = Box 1 of 1099-SA → Line 16 = $0 → no taxable income or penalty owed

The IRS's audit would close without changes. Aisha's record retention is the model — every transaction, every receipt, every category labeled.
