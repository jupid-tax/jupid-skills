# Example: $5,000 Distribution with $4,000 Qualified, $1,000 Non-Qualified

A mixed case where the user has a partial non-QME distribution. Demonstrates the taxable amount calculation, the 20% additional tax for an under-65 user, and the impact on Schedule 1 + Schedule 2.

PAYER: Fidelity Investments, EIN 04-3438911
RECIPIENT: Marcus Tate, SSN ***-**-XXXX

Box 1 (Gross distribution):                $5,000
Box 2 (Earnings on excess):                $0
Box 3 (Distribution code):                 1 (Normal)

### Distributions breakdown

| Date | Merchant | Amount | Category | QME? |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------|
| Feb 5 | CVS Pharmacy | $180 | Prescriptions | Yes |
| Mar 12 | Aetna co-pay | $250 | Doctor visit (Marcus) | Yes |
| Apr 22 | Lena's OB-GYN | $400 | Doctor visit (Lena, spouse — qualified) | Yes |
| May 1 | Pediatrician (kids) | $300 | Doctor visits (children, dependents) | Yes |
| Jun 15 | Vitamin Shoppe | $400 | Multivitamins (no Rx, general health) | **No** |
| Jul 3 | Walgreens | $90 | OTC ibuprofen + cold medicine | Yes |
| Aug 28 | Quest Diagnostics | $140 | Lab work | Yes |
| Sep 4 | Premier Fitness | $600 | Gym membership annual fee | **No** |
| Oct 11 | Dental Associates | $1,200 | Family dental cleanings + crown | Yes |
| Nov 22 | Optometrist | $440 | Eye exams + contacts (Marcus + Lena) | Yes |
| Dec 30 | UrgentCare | $1,000 | Marcus emergency room visit | Yes |
| **Total** | | **$5,000** | | $4,000 QME / $1,000 non-QME |

The two non-QME items:
- **Vitamin Shoppe ($400)**: multivitamins purchased without a Letter of Medical Necessity. General health, not QME. (If Marcus had a doctor's prescription for a specific deficiency, an LMN-supported supplement purchase would qualify — but he doesn't.)
- **Premier Fitness ($600)**: gym membership for general fitness. Not QME without a doctor's prescription for a specific medical condition like obesity treatment.

### Substantiation

Marcus has receipts for every transaction. He's clear-eyed about the non-QME portions — he knew when he made those swipes that they weren't qualified, but he wanted the convenience and is prepared to pay tax + penalty on those.

## Step-by-step computation

### Step 1 — Confirm Box 5 = HSA → Form 8889

Yes.

### Step 2 — Box 3 = Code 1 (Normal distribution)

Standard treatment: non-QME portion taxable + 20% additional tax (Marcus is 41, no exception).

### Step 3 — QME total

$4,000 (per the breakdown above).

### Step 4-5 — Form 8889 Part II computation

```

## Form 8889 Part II — line-by-line

14a. Total distributions:                        $5,000
14b. Rollovers:                                  $0
14c. Subtract 14b from 14a:                      $5,000
15.  Qualified medical expenses paid using HSA:  $4,000
16.  Taxable HSA distributions (14a − 15):       $1,000  → Schedule 1 Line 8f
17a. Exception reason:                           None (Marcus is 41, not disabled, not died)
17b. Additional 20% tax (16 × 0.20):             $200    → Schedule 2 Line 17c

## Validation summary
- Math: all checks passed
  - Line 14c = $5,000 ✓
  - Line 15 = $4,000 (substantiated with receipts) ✓
  - Line 16 = $1,000 ✓
  - Line 17b = $200 (= $1,000 × 0.20) ✓
- Sanity:
  - Marcus is 41 → 20% penalty applies (no age 65 exception) ✓
  - Marcus is not disabled, did not die → no other exceptions ✓
  - All QME for Marcus, spouse Lena, or dependent children ✓
  - Receipts retained for both QME and non-QME items ✓
- Next steps:
  - Schedule 1 Line 8f: $1,000 (added to AGI as ordinary income)
  - Schedule 2 Line 17c: $200 (additional tax on Form 1040 Line 23)
  - Marcus's marginal tax rate (likely 22% federal at his income): the $1,000 costs him $220 in income tax + $200 penalty = $420 total tax cost on the $1,000 non-QME distribution
  - For 2026: Marcus should not use his HSA for non-QME items — the 42% combined cost makes it economically irrational vs. paying out of pocket from already-taxed wages

## Why each non-obvious choice

**Why aren't multivitamins QME?** Pub 502 and IRS guidance require nutritional supplements to be **prescribed for a specific medical condition** to be QME. General-purpose multivitamins for "wellness" are not. The user can get an LMN from a doctor for a specific deficiency (e.g., vitamin D for osteoporosis prevention) and convert these to QME — but Marcus didn't.

**Why is the gym membership $600 not QME?** Same reasoning: gym memberships for general fitness are not QME. Exception: a doctor prescribes the membership for a specific condition (obesity treatment, cardiac rehabilitation), with an LMN. Without it, no.

**Why does Marcus's family qualify for QME (his spouse, his children)?** IRC §223(d)(2) allows the HSA holder to use the HSA for qualified medical expenses of:
- The HSA holder
- Their spouse
- Their tax dependents

Lena (spouse) and the two children (dependents on the joint return) all qualify.

**Why does the 20% additional tax apply?** Marcus is 41, not disabled, did not die. None of the IRC §223(f)(4)(B) exceptions apply. The 20% applies on top of ordinary income tax.

**Total cost calculation for the $1,000 non-QME**:
- Federal income tax (22% marginal rate): $220
- 20% additional tax: $200
- State income tax (varies by state — say 5%): $50
- **Total**: $470 on a $1,000 distribution = 47% effective tax rate

This makes non-QME HSA distributions economically irrational for under-65 users. Better to pay out-of-pocket from already-taxed wages and let the HSA grow tax-free.

**What if Marcus had been 65 or older?** Line 17a would mark "Age 65 or older" and Line 17b = $0. The $1,000 would still be ordinary income (Line 16), but the 20% penalty would be waived. This is the famous "HSAs become a stealth IRA at 65" feature — non-QME distributions still owe income tax but no penalty, similar to a traditional IRA at age 59½.

**Should Marcus pay back the non-QME amount?** Once a distribution is taken, the IRS rules don't allow "paying it back" except through the limited rollover rule (IRC §223(f)(5)) — and only within 60 days, once per 12 months. By the time the 1099-SA arrives in January 2026 for tax year 2025 distributions, the rollover window for Feb-Oct distributions has long passed. Marcus owes the tax + penalty.

## Audit defense

If the IRS questioned Marcus's Form 8889:
1. The HSA portal report shows $5,000 in distributions; receipts substantiate $4,000 as QME (Line 15)
2. The $1,000 non-QME items are clearly labeled (gym, multivitamins) and Marcus paid the appropriate tax + penalty
3. Schedule 1 Line 8f shows $1,000 added to AGI
4. Schedule 2 Line 17c shows $200 additional tax
5. The audit would close without changes — Marcus correctly identified and reported the non-QME portion
